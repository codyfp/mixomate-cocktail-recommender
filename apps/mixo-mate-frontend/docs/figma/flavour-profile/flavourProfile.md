## Flavour Profile Design
![flavourProfile](./flavourProfile.jpg)

A simple form where users can select and remove various flavour profiles. The flavour profiles are chip components which are selected by clicking on them - they are initially dimmed. Upon selection they can be removed via the x icon. For example Tropical and spicy are dimmed as they were not chosen.
