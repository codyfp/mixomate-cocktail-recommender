Then cut up 1.5 cups of pineapple chunks, put in mason jar, and pour the gum syrup over it and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. A few hours would work also if you don't have that much time. However, the more time, the more pineapple infusion takes place. When it's ready, strain into another mason jar or bottle, and it's ready to go.",

Vermouth will last about 3-4 months. There are many producers of vermouth, all varying in style and flavor, so we would recommend trying a couple out and finding which you prefer. It's also fun to taste the difference. This goes for both dry (French) and sweet (Italian). Depending on the type you use, you might want to adjust the quantities used in your cocktail to your liking.\n\nApricot brandy: There are many brands out there. We like to use the Rothman & Winter. Unlike other fruit liqueurs that can be cloyingly sweet, the Rothman & Winter delivers a sweetness and bouquet expected when enjoying a fresh apricot.\n\nThis is a nice cocktail for vodka martini drinkers that want a little twist on their cocktail. It's essentially a perfect martini made with vodka and apricot brandy."

The nutty flavors of the sherry brandy really play off the savory earthy notes of the Karlsson's Gold Vodka. Enjoy this cocktail with some cheese or as an after dinner drink.

Once fully infused strain out the roots and barks out using a fine mesh sieve and cheesecloth.\nUsing a funnel fill the barrel with the infusion and plug the barrel. Let infuse for 1-2 months tasting until desired oak flavor is achieved. Note: The barrel can be used several times but the aging time will take longer the more you use it. For example the second time you might need to age it for 2-3 months. Once desired oak age is achieved remove the infusion from the barrel and pour it back into the bottles There will be less then what you started with due to evaporation and soaking. Use as a base for cocktails. It makes an interesting old-fashioned."
